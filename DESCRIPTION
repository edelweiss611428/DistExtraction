Description: The package provides functions for efficiently subsetting "dist" objects in R, commonly used in dissimilarity-based clustering. Users may be interested in extracting a sub-distance matrix of class "dist" from a "dist" object, or they may want to extract pair-wises distances of units in two groups; however, we can't use 2D indexes directly to subset a "dist" object. A simple method to do this involves back and forth conversion between numeric matrices and "dist" objects using as.dist and as.matrix functions. However, it can be extremely slow, especially for large "dist" objects. The package allows us to efficiently extract values directly from a "dist" object with simple syntax.
